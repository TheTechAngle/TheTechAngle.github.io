## S3 Service Architecture

S3 is object oriented storage.

* Block-level storage - data on a raw physical storage device is divided into individual blocks whose use is managed by a file system. NTFS is a common file system used by Windows, while Linux might use Btrfs or ext4.
* Object storage - data is stored more on a flat surface.
