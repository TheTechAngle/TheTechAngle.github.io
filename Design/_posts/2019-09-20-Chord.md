## The Chord Protocol and Consistent Hashing 

### Consistent Hashing

See this amazing post for a simple explanation of the Chord System [link|https://www.acodersjourney.com/system-design-interview-consistent-hashing/#q2]
The two key things to remember about it is
* Horizontal Scalability - On the addition and/or delettion of nodes, only approx ~k/n keys have to be moved, where k is the
number of keys and n is the number of nodes. 
In the traditional hashing system (modulo n) all would have to be moved

* Solves non-uniform data distribution - It involves the introduction of a number of replicas or virtual nodes for each server across the ring. Thus giving
a chance for a more even distribution of data across nodes

### Chord
• Load balance: Chord acts as a distributed hash function,spreading keys evenly over the nodes
• Decentralization: Chord is fully distributed: no node is more important than any other. This improves robustness
• Scalability: The cost of a Chord lookup grows as the log of the number of nodes, so even very large systems are feasible. 
• Availability: Chord automatically adjusts its internal tables to reflect newly joined nodes as well as node failures.
• Flexible naming: Chord places no constraints on the structure of the keys it looks up: the Chord key-space is flat.

In an N-node network, each node maintains information about only O(log N) other nodes, and a lookup requires O(log N) messages.
