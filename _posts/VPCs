You need to be able to build your own VPC from memory. 

What is it?

The networking layer of AWS, the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud lets you provision a logically isolated section of the cloud where
you have full control over the virtual network and can deploy AWS resources.

* You can have multiple VPCs in a region, but a VPC can exist only in one region and won't show up anywhere else
* Unlike a traditional TCP/IP network, a VPC doesn't have components like routers, switches etc. Instead it
they're abstracted into software functions, allowing it to scale.

VPC CIDR Blocks
* CIDR - Classless interdomain routing block - a range of contiguous IP addresses. For example, the CIDR 
(10.0.0.0/8) includes all addresses from 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255.
* Secondary CIDR Blocks - These blocks MUST come from either the *same address range* as the primary or a publicly
routable range, but they must not overlap with the primary or other secondary blocks. If the VPC’s primary CIDR is 172.16.0.0/16, you may specify a secondary CIDR
of 172.17.0.0/16. But you may not specify 192.168.0.0/16.
