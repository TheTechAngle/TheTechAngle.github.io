title: Byzantine Fault Tolerance
---


When a node in a distributed system crashes, it stops completely. But there are other ways a node could be 'faulty'. Maybe a virus caused it to function differently or hackers programmed it to work differently. Any kind of issue with your node that causes it to function differently than expected is called a Byzantine fault.

We can check for some changes in performances using SLIs or Service Level Indicators. These indicators could be some measure of performance etc. These SLIs have SLOs or service level objectives that state the target of your SLIs. These are then included in thr SLA or service level agreements between you and your customers.
