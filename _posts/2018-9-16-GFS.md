title: The Google File System Design Condensed 
---

* A GFS cluster consists of a single master, multiple chunk servers and is accessed by multiple clients. 
* Files are divided into fixed-size chunks. 
* Each chunk is identified by an immutable and globally unique 64 bit chunk handle assigned by the master at the time of chunk creation.

### The Master Server
* The master maintains all file system metadata. This includes the mapping from files to chunks, and the current locations of chunks. 
* The master does not keep a persistent record of which chunkservers have a replica of a given chunk. It simply polls chunkservers for that information. 
* It also controls system-wide activities such as chunklease management, garbage collection of orphaned chunks, and chunk migration between chunkservers. 
* The master periodically communicates with each chunkserver in HeartBeat messages to give it instructions and collect its state.
