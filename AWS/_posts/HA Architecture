Load balancers

There are three type
1) Application LB - Best suited for balancing HTTP adn HTTPS traffic. Application aware, adn can create advanced request routing
2) Network LB - Operates at the Netwrok level, for load balancing TCP traffic
3) Classic LB - Legacy ELBs. You can load balance HTTP/S applications and use L7 specific features. You can also use strict Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on TCP protocol

They have their own DNS name, no IP address. READ FAQs
504 Error - Server has failed, not ELB

X-Forwarded-For header = to get the IP address of the actual client IP address 

Target Group - Can create target groups within the service to group instances

What are sticky sessions?- allow yoou to bind a users session to a particular ec2 instance so that sll requests from the user are sent to the same instance
classic LBs do this, so do the Application LBs, but the traffic is sent at the target group level

Cross Zone LB
 Traffic is sent to Route53. W/O Cross Xone LB, ELBs cant send traffic to other regions. With Cross Zone LB, the ELB can send traffic to other regions as well.
 
Path Patterns
Route based on paths. Can send all requests for images to one target zone/ ec2 , and everything to another
