#### What is Elasticsearch?

Let's go over the basics of Elasticsearch before we dive into Amazon's Elastic Search Service. 

Elasticsearch stores textual data in JSON document format. This is a schema-less database, a document oriented database
that uses some defaults to index the data unless you specify one. You can access all of its features via a REST API.

A cluster is a collection of servers that work together and share the data. A single server is called a node.
A shard is a subset of documents of an index, it can be divided into many shards.
